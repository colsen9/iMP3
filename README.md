# 2_jubair_2 - iMP3 Project
Backend + Frontend system for the iMP3 Music Application, developed for COM S/SE 309 (Fall 2025) at 
Iowa State University. This app allows users to create and manage playlists, browse songs and albums,
post reviews, follow other users, and receive real-time notifications through WebSockets.


## Description
The iMP3 Project is a full-stack music application that mimics key features of modern streaming platforms. Users can:
- Create, edit, and delete personal playlists/lists
- Browse albums and songs stored in the music catalog
- Post, edit, and view reviews for songs/albums
- Follow other users and receive updates in a live notification feed
- Log in and maintain persistent sessions through SpringBoot's HttpSession

## Tech Overview
- **Backend**: Java 17, Spring Boot 3, Maven, JPA (Hibernate), MariaDB
- **Frontend**: Android Studio (Java), using Volley for REST and WebSocket API communication
- **Architecture**: REST + WebSocket hybrid with Model-View-Controller organization

## Installation
TODO

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
